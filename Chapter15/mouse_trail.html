Chapter 15: Mouse Trail

In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages with lots of animated 
images, people came up with some truly inspiring ways to use the language.

One of these was the mouse trail—a series of elements that would follow the mouse pointer as 
you moved it across the page.

In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely positioned <div> elements 
with a fixed size and background color (refer to the code in the “Mouse Clicks” section for an 
example). Create a bunch of such elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in the wake of 
the mouse pointer.

There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution as simple or as complex as 
you want. A simple solution to start with is to keep a fixed number of trail elements and cycle 
through them, moving the next one to the mouse’s current position every time a "mousemove" event occurs.

<style>
  .trail { /* className for the trail elements */
    position: absolute;
    height: 6px; width: 6px;
    border-radius: 3px;
    background: teal;
  }
  body {
    height: 300px;
  }
</style>

<script>
  // Your code here.
</script>

    trails[i].classList.add("trail");
    trails[i].classList.add(i);
    document.body.appendChild(trails[i]);
  } 

  function moveTrail(event) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      trails[current_trail].style["left"] = event.clientX + "px";
      trails[current_trail].style["top"] = event.clientY + "px";
    }, 100, event);
    if(current_trail < (num_trails - 1)) {
      current_trail++;
    }
    else {
      current_trail = 0;
    }
  }

  document.body.addEventListener("mousemove", moveTrail);
