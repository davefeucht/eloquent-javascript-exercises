Chapter 2: Chess Board

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters 
to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. 
The characters should form a chess board.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change 
the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
